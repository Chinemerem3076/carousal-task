## My process

- I build this project through a step by step process.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript



### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.
I learnt how to make a Carousal in Html, css, Javascript. And also how to add functionality to with my javascript.

To see how you can add Javascript to your work, see below:
    <body>
    
        <div class="carousel">
        <!-- html File -->
        </div>

        <script src="carousal.js"></script>

</body>





### Continued development

I want to learn how to add more functionalty to my javascript. 



### Useful resources

- (https://readme.so/) - It helped me alot wg=hen trying to write my Readme.md file. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me to research and get a code to be use while writing a program. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
